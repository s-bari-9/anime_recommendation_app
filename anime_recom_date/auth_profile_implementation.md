# Authentication and User Profile Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented the authentication flow and user profile setup screens for the anime recommendation app. The implementation follows the requirements from the project specification and provides a smooth onboarding experience for users.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication with MyAnimeList
- Created a `LoginFragment` with a visually appealing login screen
- Implemented token storage and refresh mechanism using `SecureStorage`
- Added proper error handling and loading states

### 2. User Profile Setup
- Created a `ProfileSetupFragment` for collecting basic user information:
  - Name (required)
  - Age (optional)
  - Gender (optional)
  - Location (optional)
- Added validation to ensure required fields are filled
- Implemented persistence of user profile data

### 3. User Preferences Setup
- Created a `PreferencesFragment` for collecting content preferences:
  - Content type preferences (Anime, Manga, Light Novels)
  - Genre preferences with a visually pleasing chip selection interface
  - Favorite titles from the user's MyAnimeList account
- Added validation to ensure at least one content type and genre are selected
- Implemented a responsive layout with proper UI feedback

### 4. Repository Layer
- Implemented `AnimeRepository` interface and `AnimeRepositoryImpl` class
- Added methods to fetch and store user profile data
- Added methods to fetch user favorites from MyAnimeList
- Implemented local caching of user preferences and content data

### 5. Data Models
- Expanded the `User` data model to store profile and preference information
- Created proper entity classes for Room database storage
- Implemented data mapping between API responses, database entities, and domain models

### 6. Navigation
- Created a navigation graph with proper transitions between screens
- Implemented conditional navigation based on authentication status and profile completion
- Added a splash screen to check authentication status on app launch

## Integration with MyAnimeList API
- Fetches user profile data from MyAnimeList
- Retrieves the user's anime and manga lists
- Automatically identifies and displays potential favorite titles based on high ratings
- Stores user preferences for recommendation engine use

## UI Implementation
- Created responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Added proper loading indicators and error messages
- Implemented real-time validation feedback
- Used material design components for a modern look and feel

## Security Considerations
- Implemented secure storage of authentication tokens using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences
- Used PKCE for enhanced OAuth security
- Added token refresh mechanism to maintain session validity

## Features to be Completed in Next Steps
- Additional profile management screens for updating preferences
- Social integration for sharing recommendations
- More detailed profile analytics based on MyAnimeList data
