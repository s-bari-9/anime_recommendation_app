# MyAnimeList API Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive MyAnimeList API integration with a focus on authentication, data fetching, caching, and error handling. The implementation is robust, secure, and efficient, with a clean architecture that separates concerns and promotes testability.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Authentication (OAuth 2.0 with PKCE)

- **AuthManager**: Handles user authentication and token management
- **SecureStorage**: Securely stores access and refresh tokens using encryption
- **OAuthUtil**: Provides utility functions for the PKCE authentication flow

### 2. API Client and Services

- **MyAnimeListService**: Defines all API endpoints using Retrofit
- **MyAnimeListClient**: Handles API requests with proper error handling and data conversion
- **RetrofitExtensions**: Provides utilities for handling rate limits and retries

### 3. Data Handling and Caching

- **ApiResponseCache**: Multi-tiered caching system with different expiration times
- **Resource\<T\>**: Generic wrapper for handling API response states (success, error, loading)
- **Data Models**: Properly structured models for anime/manga content and API responses

### 4. Repository Layer

- **AnimeRepositoryInterface**: Clean interface for all data operations
- **AnimeRepositoryImpl**: Implementation with caching and API client integration
- **ServiceLocator**: Simple dependency injection for components

### 5. Testing

- **MyAnimeListClientTest**: Unit tests for the API client functionality

## Key Features

### Robust Authentication

- Full OAuth 2.0 with PKCE implementation
- Secure token storage using Android's encryption
- Automatic token refresh when expired
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

### Efficient Caching

- In-memory caching for API responses
- Different expiration times based on data type:
  - Short-lived (10 min) for dynamic data (recommendations)
  - Medium-lived (1 hour) for semi-static data (user lists)
  - Long-lived (4 hours) for stable data (content details)
  - Very long-lived (24 hours) for rarely changing data (rankings)

### Comprehensive Error Handling

- Resource wrapper pattern for all API responses
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Rate limit detection and handling

### Pagination Support

- Efficient handling of large data sets
- Automatic fetching of multiple pages
- Throttling to prevent rate limiting

### "Not Interested" Management

- Local storage for items the user isn't interested in
- Automatic filtering from recommendations
- Interface for adding/removing from this list

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows SOLID principles and clean architecture:

1. **UI Layer**: Interacts with the repository only
2. **Repository Layer**: Manages caching and data access
3. **API Client Layer**: Handles network requests and authentication
4. **Network Layer**: Raw API calls and response handling

This layered approach makes the code maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Future Extensions

The implementation can be extended with:

1. **Offline Support**: Using Room for persistent caching
2. **Background Syncing**: For updating user lists when online
3. **Analytics**: Tracking API usage and performance
4. **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Predictive throttling based on quota
